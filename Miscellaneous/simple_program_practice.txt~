a) Input three integers, determine their average and print the result.

   10	 rem print two integers, determine their average and print the result
   40	 rem integers to be entered
   42	 input i
   44	 input j
   46	 input k
   50	 rem add three integers to total
   52	 let t = i + j + k
   60	 rem divide total by three to obtain average
   62	 let a = t / 3
   70	 rem print the result
   72	 print a
   99	 end

b) Use a sentinel controlled loop to input ten integers, compute their sum and print the result.

   10  	 rem use a sentinel controlled loop to input ten integers,
   20  	 rem compute their sum and print the result
   22  	 initialise total
   24  	 let t = 0
   26    rem set sentinel value
   28  	 let s = -1
   30    rem input integer
   32  	 input i
   34  	 rem add i to total
   36  	 let t = t + i
   38  	 keep adding integers until sentinel is input
   40  	 if i != s goto 32
   42  	 rem print total
   44  	 print t
   99  	 end

c) Use a counter-controlled loop to input seven integers, some poitive and some negative, and
   compute and print their average.

   10	 rem use a counter-controlled loop to input seven integers, some poitive and some 
   12	 rem negative, and compute and print their average
   14	 rem initialise total t to zero
   16	 let t = 0
   18	 initialise average a to zero
   20	 let a = 0
   22	 initialise counter control m to zero
   24	 let m = 0
   26	 rem input integers and add them to total until m is equal to ten
   28	 input i
   30	 t = t + i
   32	 let m = m + 1
   34	 if m < 10 goto --
   36	 calculate average
   38	 let a = t / m
   40	 print average
   42	 print a
   99	 end

d) Input a series of integers and determine and print the largest. The first integer input
   dictates how many numbers should be processed.

   10	 rem input a series of integers and determine and print the largest
   12	 rem the first integer input dictates how many numbers should be processed
   14	 rem set the number of integers to be input
   16	 input s
   18	 rem initialise largest value to zero
   20	 let m = 0
   22	 rem initialise the iteration control variable
   24	 let c = 0
   26	 rem input integers until the first input number is reached
   28	 input i
   30	 rem compare i to m and assign m == i if i is bigger
   32	 if m > i goto 36
   34	 let m = i
   36	 let c = c + 1
   38	 if c < s goto 28
   40	 rem print the largest of the integers input
   42 	 print m
   99	 end

e) Input ten integers and print the smallest.

   10	 rem input ten integers and print the smallest.
   12	 rem set the number of integers to be input
   14	 let s = 10
   16	 rem initialise the iteration control variable
   18	 let c = 1
   20	 rem initialise smallest value to the first input number
   22	 input i
   24	 let m = i
   26	 rem input integers until the iteration control variable is reached
   28	 input j
   30	 rem compare j to m and assign m == j if j is smaller
   32	 if m < j goto 36
   34	 let m = j
   36	 let c = c + 1
   38	 if c < s goto 28
   40	 rem print the smallest of the integers input
   42 	 print m
   99	 end

f) Calculate and print the sum of the even integers from 2 and 30.

   10	 rem calculate and print the sum of the even integers from 2 and 30
   12	 rem initialise sum to zero
   14	 let s = 0
   16	 rem set i equal to two
   18	 let i = 2
   20	 rem if i is even add it to sum
   22	 if i % 2 != 0 goto --
   24	 let s = s + i
   26	 rem iterate through all integers until i is equal to 30
   28	 let i = i + 1
   30	 if i <= 30 goto --
   32	 rem print the sum
   34	 print s
   99	 end
